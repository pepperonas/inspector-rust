# Bundled AI prompt snippets

Inspector Rust ships with **25 curated AI-prompt snippets** that get seeded into your snippet table on first launch. Type the abbreviation in the search field (or use the text expander), press Enter, and the structured instruction lands in your destination app.

Introduced in **v0.5.0**. Reworked in **v0.12.0** to drop the `[REQUIREMENT]` / `[CODE]` / `[CHANGE]` … fill-in placeholders — see [How they're meant to be used](#how-theyre-meant-to-be-used).

## How they're meant to be used

These snippets are **the instruction half only** — they don't carry a "paste your input here" slot. The requirement / code / change / dataset / domain you want the LLM to act on comes from **whatever you've already written**: paste the snippet *after* (or before) your own prompt, your code, your change description, your chat-thread context. The snippet just adds the structure — *"produce a detailed implementation plan for the requirement at hand, in this exact format: …"* — and the LLM picks up the subject from the surrounding text.

So the workflow is:

1. Write (or already have) your actual prompt / code / context.
2. Append the relevant `ai*` snippet (search-field Enter, expander hotkey, or Snippets-tab Paste).
3. Send. The model answers about *your* thing, formatted the way the snippet demands.

If the surrounding context is missing something the snippet needs (target SQL dialect, framework, downtime budget, …), the snippet tells the model to ask rather than guess.

## Why bundled defaults?

Most LLM workflows live and die by prompt quality. Generic prompts get generic answers. The bundled templates are opinionated: each enforces sections, bullets, and output-format directives that have been shown to produce better-structured output across Claude / GPT / Gemini.

You can edit, delete, or extend them — they're regular snippets stored in the same SQLite table as your own. Nothing magical.

## Where they live

- **Bundled in the binary** via `include_str!` of [`core/rust-lib/src/seed/ai_prompts.json`](../core/rust-lib/src/seed/ai_prompts.json). No external file needed at runtime.
- **Seeded on first launch** by [`core/rust-lib/src/seed.rs`](../core/rust-lib/src/seed.rs)::`maybe_seed_defaults`. The `seed.default_snippets_v1` flag in the settings table tracks whether the seed has run; subsequent launches don't re-import (so user-deleted prompts stay deleted).
- **Restorable** via the Snippets-tab sidebar's **Restore defaults** button (rotate-counter-clockwise icon, next to Import). That re-imports all 25 with upsert-by-abbreviation semantics: your edits to a default get overwritten, but custom snippets with different abbreviations are untouched.

## The 25 prompts

Each row links you to its full source body in [`ai_prompts.json`](../core/rust-lib/src/seed/ai_prompts.json). The "What you get back" column summarises the structured output the prompt asks the LLM for — every prompt enforces sections, bullets, and a final output-format directive.

### Programming / DevX (8)

## Using a prompt

Three ways to put a default prompt to work:

### 1. Search field activation
Open the popup (`Ctrl+Shift+V`), type `aiplan`, press Enter. The full prompt body lands in the previously focused app.

### 2. Snippet expander hotkey (Settings → Text expander)
With the expander enabled, type `aiplan` directly in any text field — right after your own prompt text — press your configured hotkey (default `Alt+1`), and the abbreviation gets replaced in place with the full structured instruction.

### 3. Snippets-tab paste button
Open the popup → **Snippets** tab → click any prompt to select → click **Paste** in the detail pane.

## Editing the prompts

Open the **Snippets** tab → click any `ai*` prompt → edit Abbreviation / Title / Body in the right pane → **Save**.

Common customisations:
- Translate to your preferred language (we ship English because it's the highest-floor across LLMs)
- Bake in standing context about your codebase / domain (stack, conventions, the repo's name) so you don't restate it every time
- Tighten or drop section requirements that don't apply to your work
- Note: the bundled prompts deliberately have **no fill-in placeholders** — the subject comes from your surrounding text. If you'd rather have an explicit slot, add one yourself (e.g. `--- INPUT ---` at the end), but most users find appending the snippet to existing context cleaner.

If you wreck a prompt and want it back, click **Restore defaults** in the sidebar — it'll upsert all 25 to their bundled versions while leaving your custom snippets alone.

## Adding your own AI prompts

Same pattern as any other snippet:
- Click **+ New Snippet** in the Snippets tab
- Pick an abbreviation (the `ai*` prefix isn't reserved — use `mfg-en`, `meeting-notes`, whatever fits your workflow)
- Write the body — for AI prompts, structure it the way the bundled ones are: clear sections, bulleted requirements, an explicit output-format directive at the end

Or batch-import via **Import…** with a JSON file matching the snippet schema (see [`docs/snippets-import.md`](./snippets-import.md)).

## Versioning

The bundled set is versioned via the `seed.default_snippets_v1` settings flag. If a future release ships an updated prompt library, the flag suffix changes (`_v2`, etc.), forcing a re-seed for everyone. We'll only do that for genuinely substantial improvements — not for minor wording tweaks — because the re-seed will overwrite users' edits to default-keyed prompts.

> **v0.12.0 — placeholder removal.** Despite being a meaningful rework, this one did *not* bump the flag. Reasoning: a re-seed would clobber anyone's customised `ai*` prompts and resurrect deleted ones. New installs get the new placeholder-free prompts automatically; existing installs keep their current `ai*` snippets until you click **Restore defaults** in the Snippets sidebar (which upserts the new versions over the `ai*` keys, leaving your own snippets alone).

If you're maintaining your own version of a default prompt, give it a different abbreviation (`aiplan-mine`, `aiplan-de`) so it survives any future re-seed.
