//! Interactive screen-region picker for the OCR feature.
//!
//! macOS uses Apple's own `screencapture(1)` with `-i -t png` — Cmd+Shift+4
//! is *literally* this binary, so the UX is the polished one users
//! already know: drag a marquee, Esc cancels, hold Space to drag the
//! whole rect, etc. Way more reliable than reinventing an overlay
//! window in `objc2`. The captured PNG is written to a temp file we
//! then read back into memory and delete.
//!
//! Windows is stubbed for now — implementation will use either the
//! `ms-screenclip:` URI handler or a direct GDI overlay later.

// Context is used by the macOS implementation only; Linux / Windows
// stubs don't need it. Per-platform import keeps clippy happy on all
// targets without sprinkling allow attributes.
