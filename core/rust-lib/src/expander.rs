//! 1. Save the current clipboard text (best-effort — image / file

//! 2. Synthesize the platform's "select previous word" shortcut
//!    (`Option+Shift+Left` on macOS; `Ctrl+Shift+Left` elsewhere) followed
//!    by the platform copy shortcut.
//! 3. Read the now-selected word back out of the clipboard.
//! 4. Look it up in the snippets table via
//!    [`snippets::find_by_exact_abbreviation`].
//! 5. **Hit:** write the snippet body to the clipboard, synthesize paste —
//!    overwrites the still-active selection in the source app.
//! 6. **Miss:** do nothing (the selection stays visible so the user
//!    notices the failed match).
//! 7. Restore the original clipboard text after a small delay.
